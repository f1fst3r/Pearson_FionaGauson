Pearson Technical Exercises for Developer Role

My program is a .py file that can be run in VSCode (and other python IDEs)

The user will be prompted to choose the exercise to test and whether to use test cases.
Invalid inputs are handled and dealt with accordingly.

Methods within the .py file are documented.

I had some issues with the clarity of Exercise 3: Fibonacci and am willing to discuss this if my solution is not what was expected.
